# Vy Dang  
Bioinformatics | Graduate Student

I am a computational biology researcher building cross-disciplinary expertise in transcriptomics, structural bioinformatics, and high-performance data pipelines. My work focuses on developing workflows across multiple domains of bioinformatics while strengthening both biological insight and computational rigor.

## Current Focus
- Protein structure trajectory modeling

## Featured Projects

### 🧬 Genome Assembly and Annotation
De novo genome assembly using short-read sequencing data followed by structural and functional annotation.

Tools: SPAdes, QUAST, Prokka, BLAST

### 🔬 RNA-Seq Differential Expression – NUDT21 Knockdown
End-to-end RNA-seq analysis pipeline for NUDT21 knockdown including read QC, alignment (HISAT2), quantification (featureCounts), differential expression (limma-voom), and GO-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (clusterProfiler) in Homo Sapiens

**Key results**
- 11,450 genes significant (FDR < 0.05)
- Ribosome biogenesis & RNA processing pathways strongly affected

Tools: HISAT2, samtools, Subread, FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic, featureCounts, ggplot2, Bioconductor, EnhancedVolcano, limma-voom, clusterProfiler
