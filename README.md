# Vy Dang  
Bioinformatics | Graduate Student

I am a computational biology researcher building cross-disciplinary expertise in transcriptomics, structural bioinformatics, and high-performance data pipelines. My work focuses on developing workflows across multiple domains of bioinformatics while strengthening both biological insight and computational rigor.

## Current Focus
- Differential RNA-seq analysis (NUDT21 knockdown)
- Protein structure trajectory modeling

## Featured Projects

### 🧬 Genome Assembly and Annotation
De novo genome assembly using short-read sequencing data followed by structural and functional annotation.

Tools: SPAdes, QUAST, Prokka, BLAST

---

### 🔬 RNA-Seq Differential Expression – NUDT21 Knockdown
End-to-end paired-end RNA-seq analysis pipeline using SRA Toolkit, HISAT2, featureCounts, and DESeq2 to identify transcriptional changes following gene knockdown in Homo sapiens.

Tools: Bash, HISAT2, Samtools, Subread, R

---

### 🧬 Protein Structural Trajectory Modeling
Trajectory inference of protein isoforms using RMSD-based clustering and structural similarity analysis.

Tools: Python, MDAnalysis, PyTorch
