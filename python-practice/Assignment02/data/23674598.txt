The neural crest 
The neural crest (NC) is a highly migratory multipotent cell population that forms at the interface between the neuroepithelium and the prospective epidermis of a developing embryo Following extensive migration throughout the embryo NC cells eventually settle to differentiate into multiple cell types ranging from neurons and glial cells of the peripheral nervous system to pigment cells fibroblasts to smooth muscle cells and odontoblasts to adipocytes NC cells migrate in large numbers and their migration is regulated by multiple mechanisms including chemotaxis contact-inhibition of locomotion and cell sorting Here we provide an overview of NC formation differentiation and migration highlighting the molecular mechanisms governing NC migration
